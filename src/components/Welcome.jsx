                The DIY Music Action Network Gear Share is a source for
                musicians in Massachusetts to borrow music gear for any practice
                or performance needs. The equipment is provided voluntarily by
                members of our community and is available for loan, free of
                charge, to anyone who agrees to a few basic guidelines of care
                and accountability. You can use this website to sign our
                community guidelines (which will allow you to borrow gear),
                browse the gear in our library, and submit gear that you would
                want to donate to this cause. Thanks for visiting and please
                consider getting involved in our network!
